# Product Requirements Document (PRD):

*Detailed functional requirements, market analysis, and system design specifications.
*Defined user segments, including small, moderate, and large commercial users.
*Focused on achieving higher efficiency, scalability, and ease of use through app integration.

# Beta Testing Plan & Execution:

*Designed and executed a comprehensive beta testing plan for various system configurations.
*Involved real commercial users in a multi-phase testing approach, gathering feedback on system performance, app interaction, and pricing models.
*Results from beta testing were used to refine the final product, focusing on app usability and error handling.

# Impact Assessment:

*Internal Impact: Enhanced supply chain operations, trained staff on new technologies, and improved cross-department collaboration.
*External Impact: Validated customer demand for eco-friendly, cost-efficient heating systems. The product successfully addressed commercial usersâ€™ needs for flexible system sizes and advanced technology.

# Additional Information:
*Prototype Development: Includes solar collector options and app integration for system management.
*Usability Testing: Focused on the app's ease of use, ensuring commercial users can efficiently manage the system with minimal training or guidance.
*Final Outcome: The project concluded with a high satisfaction rate (4.5/5) from beta participants, preparing SRU for a full-scale product launch.
